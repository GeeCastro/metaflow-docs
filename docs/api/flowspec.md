# FlowSpec - Constructing flows

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

Metaflow [flows are defined](/metaflow/basics) by inhering from the `FlowSpec` class:
```python
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step

class MyFlow(FlowSpec):

    @step
    def start(self):
        self.next(self.end)
       
    @step
    def end(self):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyFlow()
```

This class has no other uses. It can't be instantiated directly.

`FlowSpec` exposes a few methods and attributes that you can use to construct a flow, which are listed below. You can add more functionality in your flows through [decorators](decorators). To query and manipulate the currently executing run inside your flow, see the [`current`](current) object. To access results produced by a flow, see the [Client API](client).

### Defining a workflow

Annotate methods that are a part of your Metaflow workflow with [the `@step` decorator](/api/step-decorators/step). Use `FlowSpec.next` to define transitions between steps:

<Description summary="Indicates the next step to execute after this step has completed." extended_summary="This statement should appear as the last statement of each step, except\nthe end step.\n\nThere are several valid formats to specify the next step:\n\n- Straight-line connection: `self.next(self.next_step)` where `next_step` is a method in\n  the current class decorated with the `@step` decorator.\n\n- Static fan-out connection: `self.next(self.step1, self.step2, ...)` where `stepX` are\n  methods in the current class decorated with the `@step` decorator.\n\n- Foreach branch:\n  ```\n  self.next(self.foreach_step, foreach='foreach_iterator')\n  ```\n  In this situation, `foreach_step` is a method in the current class decorated with the\n  `@step` docorator and `foreach_iterator` is a variable name in the current class that\n  evaluates to an iterator. A task will be launched for each value in the iterator and\n  each task will execute the code specified by the step `foreach_step`." />

### Working with foreaches

Use the operations below, `FlowSpec.input`, `FlowSpec.index`, and `FlowSpec.foreach_stack` to query the status of the currently executing foreach branch. Use `FlowSpec.merge_artifacts()` to handle incoming artifacts in a join step.
